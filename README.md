### Hello, I'm Dylan Ierugan 

I'm an iOS developer at Walmart.

I taught myself how to build apps using UIKit. Currently, I'm learning Apple's new framework, SwiftUI.

I've recenently published a gym log app, called DylFyt. The code isn't public on my Github, but you can check it out here: https://apps.apple.com/us/app/dylfyt/id1638374124
