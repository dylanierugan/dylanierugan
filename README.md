### Hello ðŸ‘‹ I'm Dylan Ierugan, an iOS Developer

I learned how to make and build app using UIKit. Currently, I'm learning Apple's new framework, SwiftUI, as it's much more efficient and I'm excited to make use of all the new capabilities.

I'm building lots of small apps to properly learn the new framework, and I'm also slowly making progress on a larger scale fitness tracker app.
