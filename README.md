### Hello, I'm Dylan Ierugan 

I'm a senior cs student at UIC currently taking secure web development and mobile app dev with Flutter.

I taught myself how to build apps using UIKit. Currently, I'm learning Apple's new framework, SwiftUI, as it's much more efficient and I'm excited to make use of all the new capabilities.

I've recenently published a gym log app, called DylFyt. The code isn't public on my Github, but you can check it out here: https://apps.apple.com/us/app/dylfyt/id1638374124
